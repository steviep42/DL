    "\n",
    "There are a number of Deep Learning frameworks with Google's Tensorflow being one of the more popualr ones. It's been around for a while and is actively developed. The initial version was released in 2015 with the most recent version 2.0 being released in 2019. From the Wikipedia page:\n",
